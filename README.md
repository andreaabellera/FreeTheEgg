## Dynamic JS Frameworks Demo

An intro to dynamic frameworks such as React, Vue, Svelte that make modern web applications. 

Learn the basics of NodeJS, reactive states, components, and state management with live samples in this Github repository.


### Demo app

**Free the Egg** is a game where that opens your homepage (`route: /`) to an image of an egg. Clicking the egg will attempt to crack it. But as any adventurer is, you start of weak and puny ‚òπÔ∏è 

But venture not far, there be quests from the other pages of the site!
Each quest introduces a dynamic web concept for your framework of choice, with an activity.
- **Math** (`route: /math`) introduces reactive states.
- **Artist** (`route: /artist`) introduces props.
- **Unbox** (`route: /unbox`) introduces slots.

You may click the egg whenever you feel ready, but only the egg shall know its worthy cracker.  
Will you be strong enough and worthy to break the egg? ü•ö

*Hint: You can track your progression as the orbs turn from red to green.*
